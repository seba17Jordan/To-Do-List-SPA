# To-Do-List-SPA
## (Note: to see the project go to Master Branch)
This is a basic to-do SPA, i developed it as part of an online course tutorial. The app covers essential features such as user auth (with cookies), allowing users to register and log in easily. It also allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks with persistent data and no reload (single page application).
